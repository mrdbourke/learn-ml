Yo!

I'd like to start a machine learning blog.

A website too.

With ML concepts + code, interesting learns, tutorials and more.

I've got [my other blog too](https://www.mrdbourke.com) which is excellent for less-tech orientated things (but also some tech things).

Anyway, this website will be more focused on the pure ML side of things.

For now, there's not much.

But I'll slowly build it up over time.

Best not to overthink these things.

That's the big killer.

Just create what your heart sings to create.

It's the best long-term strategy.

Now, first thing is first, get the domain (learnml.io) and get the website live.

That's some motivation to keep going!

Publish, publish, publish!
